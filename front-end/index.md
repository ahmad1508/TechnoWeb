# Material Design and MUI (formerly Material-UI)

**Material Design** is a design system created by Google to help teams build high-quality digital experiences for Android, iOS, Flutter, and the web.

**MUI** (formerly Material-UI) is the most popular React UI framework based on the Material Design recommendations.

## What is Material Design

* Inspired by the physical world and its textures, including how they reflect light and cast shadows.
* Announced in 2014 by Google.
* Guided by print design methods — typography, grids, space, scale, color, and imagery — to create hierarchy, meaning, and focus.
* Use motion to focus attention and maintain continuity through subtle feedback and coherent transitions.

## Material components

* Interactive building blocks for creating a user interface.
* Components cover a range of interface needs, including:
  * *Display*   
  Placing and organizing content using components like cards, lists, and sheets.
  * *Navigation*   
  Allowing users to move through the product using components like navigation drawers and tabs.
  * *Actions*   
  Allowing users to perform tasks using components such as the floating action button.
  * *Input*   
  Allowing users to enter information or make selections using components like text fields, chips, and selection controls.
  * *Communication*   
  Alerting users to key information and messages using components such as snack bars, banners, and dialogs.
